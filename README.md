# Personal Projects Archive

This repository serves as a showcase and archive for some of the technical and research projects I worked on in my earlier years. While many of these were developed as part of academic or extracurricular programs, they each reflect a period of deep exploration and learning.

## üéµ Musical Genre Classification Using a MFCC-Fed Artificial Neural Network

`2019` `Petnica Science Center` [`Paper`](../main/musical_genre_classification_using_a_mfcc_fed_neural_network/paper.pdf) [`Poster`](../main/musical_genre_classification_using_a_mfcc_fed_neural_network/poster.pdf)

Developed a machine learning model in MATLAB to classify audio samples into one of five musical genres based on their MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features. The project involved tuning neural network parameters to optimize classification accuracy and analyzing the results to draw meaningful insights about model performance.

## ‚öõ Designing an Experiment to Measure H‚ÇÇ‚Å∫ Production in IsoDAR‚Äôs Multicusp Ion Source

`2018` `Research Science Institute` `Massachusetts Institute of Technology` [`Paper`](../main/designing_an_experiment_to_measure_h2p_production_in_isodars_multicusp_ion_source/paper.pdf)

Conducted simulations to determine the optimal configuration for measuring H‚ÇÇ‚Å∫ ion production in the multicusp ion source used by the IsoDAR neutrino experiment. This involved understanding beam dynamics, analyzing ion generation efficiency, and proposing a viable experimental setup for future implementation.

## üåà Spectral Analysis of Different Light Sources Using a Homemade Spectrometer

`2017` [`Paper`](../main/spectral_analysis_of_different_light_sources_using_a_homemade_spectrometer/paper.pdf) [`Poster`](../main/spectral_analysis_of_different_light_sources_using_a_homemade_spectrometer/poster.png)

Designed and built a functional spectrometer with a total cost under ‚Ç¨60. The device was controlled by custom-developed software, and the resulting spectral data was compared to that of a professional spectrometer. The project concluded with a detailed evaluation and proposals for improvements in both hardware and software.
